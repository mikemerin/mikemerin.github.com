The first time you see a regular expression it may just look like a jumble of random characters that don't mean anything, including what may look like a roller coaster of slashes and back-slashes that look like `/\/`. Learning regular expressions (aka RegExp) also sometimes feels like a roller coaster, so let's break it down to make it as easy as possible to master.

# Languages

Thankfully RegExp works virtually identically between most languages like Ruby, JavaScript, Python, SQL, etc., so let's just quickly look at how those languages can handle a simple query. For example: `/\d/` means "find any digit". I'll explain that query later, but for now let's just quickly see how to invoke this in different languages:

```ruby
string = "1234"
string.match(/\d/) #=> <MatchData "1">
s2[/\d/] #=> "1"
```
