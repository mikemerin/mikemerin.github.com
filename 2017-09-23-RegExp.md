The first time you see a regular expression it may just look like a jumble of random characters that don't mean anything, including what may look like a roller coaster of slashes and back-slashes that look like `/\/`. Learning regular expressions (aka RegExp) also sometimes feels like a roller coaster, so let's break it down to make it as easy as possible to master.

# Languages
---
Thankfully RegExp works virtually identically between most languages like Ruby, JavaScript, SQL, etc., so let's just quickly look at how Ruby and JavaScript can handle a simple query. For example: `/s/` means "find the letter `s`". I'll explain the query a bit more in depth later, but for now let's just quickly see how to invoke this in different languages:

```ruby
# Ruby
Regexp.new("s") #=> /s/

"strings".match(/s/) #=> <MatchData "s">
/s/.match("strings") #=> <MatchData "s">
"strings"[/s/] #=> "s"

"strings".scan(/s/) #=> ["s", "s"]

# getting the index
/s/ =~ "strings" #=> 0
/r/ =~ "strings" #=> 2
"strings" =~ /s/ #=> 0
"strings" =~ /r/ #=> 2
```

```javascript
// JavaScript
RegExp("s") //=> /s/

/s/.test("strings") //=> true

"strings".match(/s/)
//=> ["s", index: 0, input: "strings"]
/s/.exec("strings")
//=> ["s", index: 0, input: "strings"]

"strings".match(/r/)[0] //=> "r"
"strings".match(/r/).index //=> 0
```

As you can see the syntax is nearly identical, and the actual RegExp syntax will be the same for both languages. With that said, I'll be using JS's "match" method from here on out since it's the same as Ruby's match method but gives both the output as well as the index.
