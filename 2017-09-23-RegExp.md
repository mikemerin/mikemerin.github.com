The first time you see a regular expression it may just look like a jumble of random characters that don't mean anything, including what may look like a roller coaster of slashes and back-slashes that look like `/\/`. Learning regular expressions (aka RegExp) also sometimes feels like a roller coaster, so let's break it down to make it as easy as possible to master.

What inspired this post was a [question on Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/regex-password-validation) about using regular expressions to validate a strong password. I'll go piece by piece to solve that and in doing so learn many different techniques!

# Languages
---
Thankfully RegExp works virtually identically between most languages like Ruby, JavaScript, SQL, etc., so let's just quickly look at how Ruby and JavaScript can handle a simple query. For example: `/s/` means "find the letter `s`". I'll explain the query a bit more in depth later, but for now let's just quickly see how to invoke this in different languages:

```ruby
# Ruby
Regexp.new("s") #=> /s/

"strings".match(/s/) #=> <MatchData "s">
/s/.match("strings") #=> <MatchData "s">
"strings"[/s/] #=> "s"

"strings".scan(/s/) #=> ["s", "s"]

# getting the index
/s/ =~ "strings" #=> 0
/r/ =~ "strings" #=> 2
"strings" =~ /s/ #=> 0
"strings" =~ /r/ #=> 2
```

```javascript
// JavaScript
RegExp("s") //=> /s/

/s/.test("strings") //=> true

"strings".match(/s/)
//=> ["s", index: 0, input: "strings"]
/s/.exec("strings")
//=> ["s", index: 0, input: "strings"]

"strings".match(/r/)[0] //=> "r"
"strings".match(/r/).index //=> 0
```

As you can see the syntax is nearly identical, and the actual RegExp syntax will be the same for both languages. With that said, I'll be using JS's "match" method from here on out since it's the same as Ruby's match method but gives both the output as well as the index.


# Basics

At least six characters long
contains a lowercase letter
contains an uppercase letter
contains a number
Valid passwords will only be alphanumeric characters.


```javascript
// at least six characters long
const s1 = "pass"
const s2 = "password"
const s3 = "Password"
const s4 = "Password!"
const s5 = "Password1"

s1.match(/.{6,}/)
null

s2.match(/.{6,}/)
[ 'password', index: 0, input: 'password' ]

s4.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9]{6,}$/)
null

s5.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9]{6,}$/)
[ 'Password1', index: 0, input: 'Password1' ]

```
