Note that there are more blogs on my [main page](https://mikemerin.github.io) that you can learn from.

I love teaching, so what other way to do so than educating others? I have blogs teaching Ruby, JavaScript, Python, PHP, RegExp, SQL, and more, along with every other blog written in the style of helping others learn new techniques and gain new programming knowledge. If you have any suggestions or questions let me know!
